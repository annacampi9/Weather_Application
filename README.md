## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather_application.git
   cd weather_application
    ```
2. Create a .env file in the project directory and add your API key:

   ```bash
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Dynamic Backgrounds

The app dynamically updates the background based on the `weather_id` from the OpenWeatherMap API. The mappings are as follows:

| Weather Group | Description      | Background Image |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2xx           | Thunderstorm     | `thunder.jpg`    |
| 3xx           | Drizzle          | `mist.jpg`       |
| 5xx           | Rain             | `rain.jpg`       |
| 6xx           | Snow             | `snow.jpg`       |
| 8xx (800)     | Clear Sky        | `clear_sky.jpg`  |
| 8xx (801-804) | Clouds           | `cloudy.jpg`     |
